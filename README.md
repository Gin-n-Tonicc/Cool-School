This codebase was created to show a full application built with React with TypeScript that uses Java with Spring Boot as backend server with CRUD operations, authentication, routing, filtering and more.

# Making requests to the backend API

For convenience, the API server is in the project files so everyone can host it on their own computer. In order to run the server, open the project in IntelliJ or any IDE of your choice and run it from there. Make sure you have Java installed!

If you want to change the API URL, simply edit `client/.env` and change `REACT_APP_API_URL` to the server's URL (i.e. `localhost:3000/api`)

# Getting started

I use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage the dependencies. It should be automatically installed with node. Open a terminal in the client folder and run `npm install` or `npm i` to resolve all dependencies.
Also run the backend server using an IDE, it should start on `http://localhost:8080`. Make sure to change the application.yaml file to your own needs before running the backend server locally.

Run `npm start` in the client folder for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
